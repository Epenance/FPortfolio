    I am Martin Hobert — a front-end developer based in Helsinge, Denmark. I love coding complex  as well as simple designs that keeps the end user in mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    My interest for the web and design sparked when I was just a young kid of the age 12 living at home helping my parents out setting up their kennel website.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've since then taken the Webintegrator degree and worked at several companies as well as running my own web agency for several years.

    Knowledge and Experience
  </p>
  <p>
    Ive been around and about, I've worked with many different languages such as Ruby on Rails, PHP, C#, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and more. I started out as a overall programmer who did both Backend and Frontend work for my agency, taking PSD's and turning them into actual functional websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    I later on realized how much I enjoyed Frontend developing and figuring out ways to "communicate" with my visitors, proudly showing them around my websites with CTA placements.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love challenging myself and always try to learn new things when doing a project, as well as reading a ton of articles in order to keep up with the newest technologies.

    Prefered tools
  </p>
  <p>
    My prefered editor is Atom, cause of its slick design and the great community who creates packages for pretty much anything you could ever want.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use Grunt as my task runner and use Slim as my templating engine for most projects with CoffeeScript, SCSS and Compass making everything look and work beatifully.
